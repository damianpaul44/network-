<p>
I am an Infrastructure Network Engineer and Web Developer with a strong analytical foundation in Physics from Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma. My academic journey was shaped by resilience and discipline, overcoming academic disruptions and financial challenges while remaining focused on technical growth.

My interest in technology began during my third year at university, where I started developing skills in web technologies alongside my studies. During my Industrial Training at the Nigeria Television Authority (NTA), I gained hands-on experience in IT operations and was entrusted with the role of Head of I.T., where I supported system management, troubleshooting, and structured technical workflows.
</p>
<p>
During my service year, I expanded my expertise in network infrastructure, working on network configuration, system maintenance, troubleshooting connectivity issues, and supporting stable and secure IT environments. This practical exposure strengthened my foundation in infrastructure systems and reinforced my career path in network engineering.

To further enhance my skills, I completed an intensive web development program at Complete Computer Institute, where I was recognized for delivering the best project presentation. I specialize in building responsive, accessible, and performance optimized web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I focus on writing clean, semantic, and maintainable code while applying component-based architecture for scalability and long term sustainability.

My combined experience in network infrastructure and front-end development allows me to understand both system-level operations and user facing technologies. I am committed to continuous learning, technical excellence, and delivering reliable, scalable, and efficient IT solutions.
</p>



<p>
I specialize in building responsive, accessible, semantic, and
high-performance websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
